 Important Hair Blow Drying and Styling Instructions


By following these instructions, you will not only save time but also maintain healthy, breakage-free, and frizz-free hair. Proper blow drying and styling techniques are crucial for achieving the desired results while keeping your hair in optimal condition. Let's go through the step-by-step process.

Step 1: Brushing
1. After washing your hair with shampoo and conditioner, towel dry it thoroughly.
2. Gently brush your hair with a Wet Brush, ensuring to brush the sides of your hair down. Avoid brushing the sides back.

Step 2: Air Drying
If you choose to air dry your hair before blow drying, it's important to follow these guidelines: 
Do not exceed 25 minutes of air drying time - air drying hair completely can significantly increase frizz, weaken the hair over time. The persistent and excessive swelling and de-swelling of the hair can impact the lipid layer causing strands to become weak, permanently dry, and less elastic, leading to breakage.
- We recommend waiting for 25 minutes after washing your hair, which will bring the moisture level down from 100% to about 60%. This will reduce styling time without harming your hair.

Step 3: Blow Drying
Hold your blow dryer high up and always point the warm air down - towards the ends of your hair.
Avoid drying all bulky sections at once without splitting it.
3. Separate and clip the back section of your hair into 2-4 horizontal sections. Start blow drying from the lowest section and work your way up to the upper section near your crown. Repeat the same for the side sections.
4. Avoid blow drying the same spot for too long. Move the blow dryer up and down and side to side on each section to ensure even air distribution.
5. Pre-dry your hair from 60% to about 20% using your fingers or a flat brush.
6. When your hair is about 80% dry everywhere, clip the hair into horizontal sections again for the round brush polishing part.
7. Use a round brush and medium heat to polish and close
 the hair cuticle. Remove the lower clip and drop each section from the lowest to the highest while blow drying. Keep the hair dryer nozzle approximately 1.5 inches away from the brush, maintaining a sharp angle of about 35Â°. Repeat the same for the side sections.
This polishing method is crucial as it will enhance flexibility and shine by smoothing and sealing the hair cuticle.

By following these instructions, you'll be able to achieve a beautifully styled hair while maintaining its health and preventing breakage and frizz. Enjoy your styling experience!
